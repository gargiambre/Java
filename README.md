# **Java**
Java is a powerful, object-oriented programming language widely used for building applications ranging from enterprise systems to mobile and web applications.

## **Key Features of Java**
Platform Independence: Java follows the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) principle, meaning compiled Java code can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Object-Oriented: Java follows OOP principles, making it modular, reusable, and scalable.

Memory Management: Java includes automatic garbage collection to manage memory efficiently.

Multithreading: Java supports multithreading, allowing concurrent execution of multiple tasks.

Security: Java provides robust security features, including runtime checking and bytecode verification.

## **Common Uses of Java**
Enterprise Applications: Used in banking, e-commerce, and large-scale applications (Spring, Hibernate).

Mobile Development: Core language for developing Android apps.

Web Development: Java frameworks like Spring Boot and Jakarta EE are used for backend web applications.

Game Development: Used in creating games with libraries like LibGDX and jMonkeyEngine.

Big Data & AI: Java is utilized in big data processing (Hadoop) and machine learning (Deeplearning4j).
